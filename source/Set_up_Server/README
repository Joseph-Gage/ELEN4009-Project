This document contains instructions on how to setup up the project environment
for the Friends Analyzer Project.

The following system specifications are assumed:

- Python 2.7 is installed (sudo apt-get install python)
- pip is installed (sudo apt-get install python-pip python-dev build-essential)
- aptitude is installed (sudo apt-get install aptitude)
- Apache2 is installed (sudo apt-get install apache2)

How to setup Django Framework (Ubuntu):

1)sudo pip install Django
2) Save the Project Folder "friendAnalyzer" in the following directory:
		"/var/www"

3) Go to directory "/var/www/friendAnalyzer" (in terminal) and enter:
		python manage.py runserver

		This is now running the Django server

4) In a browser, go to : "127.0.0.1:8000"
	If a friend Analyzer homepage loads, Django set up is complete.
	The Django server can now be stopped (with Crlt + Z)  


How to setup Apache Server (Ubuntu):

1) sudo apititude install libapache2-mod-wsgi
2) Replace "/etc/apache2/sites-available/000-default.conf" with  "$GITPATH/ELEN4009-Project/source/Set_up_Server/000-default.conf".

3) Open "000-default" and ensure that all the directories and Admin infomation is correct. Path directories should be valid and exist.

4) Open "/etc/apache2/apache.conf" and add (to the last line):

	WSGIPythonPath /var/www/friendAnalyzer

5) Go to "/var/www" and make a directory called "logs" :

		 sudo mkdir logs

	then:
		 sudo chmod 777 logs

6) In directory "/var/www" enter the following:
	service apache2 restart

7) In browser, go to : "localhost"
	Again, Friend Analyzer Project homepage should load.
	This time it is using the Apache server.
	Setup is now complete.
