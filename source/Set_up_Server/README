This document contains instructions on how to setup up the project environment
for the Friends Analyzer Project.

The following system specifications are assumed:
- Python 2.7 is installed
- pip is installed (sudo apt-get install pip)
- aptitude is installed (sudo apt-get install aptitude)

How to setup Django Framework (Ubuntu):

1) pip install Django
2) Save the Project Folder "friendAnalyzer" in the following directory:
		"/var/www"

3) Go to directory "/var/www/friendAnalyzer" (in terminal) and enter:
		python manage.py runserver

		This is now running the Django server

4) In a browser, go to : "127.0.0.1:8000"
	If a friend Analyzer homepage loads, Django set up is complete.
	The Django server can now be stopped (with Crlt + Z)  


How to setup Apache Server (Ubuntu):

1) sudo apt-get install apache2
2) sudo apititude install libapache2-mod-wsgi
3) Go to "/etc/apache2/sites-available" and replace "000-default.conf" with 
	the "000-default.conf" attached.

4) Open "000-default" and ensure that all the directories and Admin infomation
	is correct. Path directories should be valid and exist.

5) Open "/etc/apache2/apache.conf" and add (to the last line):
	 	WSGIPythonPath /var/www/friendAnalyzer

6) Go to "/var/www" and make a directory called "logs" :

		 sudo mkdir logs
	then:
		 chmod 777 logs

7) In directory "/var/www" enter the following:
	service apache2 restart

8) In browser, go to : "localhost"
	Again, Friend Analyzer Project homepage should load.
	This time it is using the Apache server.
	Setup is now complete.
